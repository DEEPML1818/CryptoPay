Cross-Chain Page Not Found & Additional Pages
- Implement a Custom 'Page Not Found' Error Page:
- Create a generic 404 error page that displays a friendly message when a user navigates to a non-existent route.
- Ensure that this page is triggered for any erroneous or missing URL, including the case where the Cross-Chain page is not found.
- Include navigation links (or a button) that redirect users back to the Dashboard or the main menu.
- Develop a Dedicated Cross-Chain Operations Page:
- Build a Cross-Chain page that displays information about cross-chain transactions using Wormhole.
- If this page fails to load because of an invalid URL, the custom 404 page should be displayed.
- Provide clear instructions and a link to retry connection or view other parts of the app.
- Add a Few Other Essential Pages:
- Dashboard:
- Show live wallet balances, recent transaction data, and notifications.
- Transaction History:
- Display real transaction details (including cross-chain operations) fetched live from the backend and on-chain data.
- Invoice Management:
- Include functions like "Direct Pay" and invoice CRUD operations, ensuring smooth transitions even if a page isn’t found.
- Routing & Navigation:
- Use React Router (or your preferred routing library) to define routes for all these pages.
- Ensure that any undefined route automatically renders the custom 404 (Page Not Found) component.
- Test navigation locally on Replit to verify that the Cross-Chain page and additional pages load properly, and that the “Page Not Found” page is triggered correctly when needed.
- Live Data Integration:
- Make sure that the Cross-Chain page (and all pages) is hooked up to display live data via your integration with Wormhole.
- Ensure all error handling gracefully guides the user back to working pages if the Cross-Chain page’s data cannot be loaded.

Action Items:
- Step 1: Create a NotFound.jsx (or similar) component in your React client that shows a friendly 404 error.
- Step 2: Define a route to this component using your router’s wildcard route (e.g., *).
- Step 3: Implement the Cross-Chain page and integrate it to pull real-time data from your Wormhole integration.
- Step 4: Add additional pages (Dashboard, Transaction History, Invoice Management) and ensure seamless navigation.
- Step 5: Test on Replit that navigating to an unknown or malfunctioning Cross-Chain URL displays the 404 error page, and that all expected pages work correctly.
