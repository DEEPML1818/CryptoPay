CryptoPay – Decentralized Payroll & Invoicing Platform on Solana
Project Overview
CryptoPay simplifies payroll, invoicing, and payments for businesses and freelancers by integrating Solana’s high-speed blockchain, off-chain fiat conversion (via Mercuryo), and automated payment scheduling (via Streamflow). Users are prompted to select their role (Client or Freelancer) at wallet creation, which then loads a tailored interface featuring role-specific dashboards, invoice management, and payment functionalities.

Replit Project Structure
Organize your Replit project as a monorepo structured into three main directories:
/ (project root)
├── client/         # React frontend (Tailwind CSS) implementing separate UIs for Clients and Freelancers
├── server/         # Node.js backend (Express.js) to connect with Solana, Mercuryo, and Streamflow
└── program/        # Solana smart contract written in Rust using the Anchor framework


Configure the Replit environment with proper language runtimes for Node.js and Rust (Anchor CLI) and ensure your secret keys (API keys, wallet seeds) are stored securely in environment variables.

1. On-Chain Program (Smart Contracts with Rust & Anchor)
Location: /program
Technologies: Rust, Anchor
Main Objectives:
- Maintain on-chain state for invoices, escrow payments, and transaction tracking.
- Control state transitions (Invoice creation, payment, refund, release).
Key Implementation Details:
- Account Structures & Enums:
- Create an Invoice struct with fields such as invoice ID, business and freelancer public keys, amount, due date, status, and metadata.
- Use an InvoiceStatus enum (e.g., Pending, Escrowed, Paid, Refunded).
#[account]
pub struct Invoice {
    pub id: u64,
    pub business: Pubkey,
    pub freelancer: Pubkey,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub status: InvoiceStatus,
    pub due_date: i64,
    pub metadata: String, // up to 200 characters
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum InvoiceStatus {
    Pending,
    Escrowed,
    Paid,
    Refunded,
}
- Instruction Handlers:
- create_invoice: Initializes an invoice based on user input.
- pay_invoice: Transitions an invoice to escrow by transferring funds from a Client to a PDA-managed escrow account.
- release/refund: Allow releasing funds to the Freelancer upon work approval or refunding back to the Client if conditions aren’t met.
- Use Anchor’s macros and secure PDAs for multi-signature and escrow management.
- Optimization & Advanced Features:
- Apply Solana’s compute budget API to lower transaction fees.
- Consider introducing recurring payments and vesting schedules that can automatically disburse funds over time (possibly via integrated Streamflow SDK).

2. Off-Chain Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
Location: /server
Technologies: Node.js, Express, @solana/web3.js
Responsibilities:
- API Endpoints:
- Invoice Endpoints:
- POST /api/invoice: Accepts invoice details and calls the on-chain create_invoice instruction.
- GET /api/invoices: Returns invoice data (with filtering/sorting).
- Payment Endpoints:
- POST /api/invoice/:id/pay: Processes payments using Solana transactions for escrow creation.
- POST /api/invoice/:id/convert: Integrates with Mercuryo’s API for fiat-crypto on-/off-ramping.
- Middleware & Error Handling:
- Validate inputs, log transactions, and securely forward instructions to the on-chain program.
- Use environment variables (in a .env file) to store API keys and endpoint URLs for Mercuryo and Streamflow.
- Real-Time Event Listener:
- Develop a WebSocket or polling mechanism to monitor on-chain events (like status changes on invoices) and send live notifications to the frontend.

3. Frontend (React & TailwindCSS) with Role-Based Interfaces
Location: /client
Technologies: React.js, TailwindCSS, @solana/wallet-adapter, React Router
Overview:
The frontend must provide tailored user journeys based on the role selected at wallet creation. When a user creates a new wallet (or logs in), they are prompted to choose either Client or Freelancer. This selection configures the navigation, dashboard layout, and available actions.
Key UI Components & Flows:
- Wallet Creation & Role Selection:
- Onboarding Screen:
- Present a clean sign-up/sign-in screen integrating social sign-ins (Google/Apple) alongside wallet generation.
- Include a role selector (radio buttons or toggle) to let the user choose between Client and Freelancer. Save this selection locally (or on-chain, if desired) to load the appropriate interface.
- Separate Dashboards:
- Client (Business) Dashboard:
- Invoice Management:
- Create and view invoices.
- Track payment statuses, view conversion details if fiat integration is used.
- Payment Processing:
- Initiate escrow payments for projects and approve multi-signature or recurring payment requirements.
- Analytics & Notifications:
- Display charts showing total payments, pending invoices, and recent transactions.
- Freelancer Dashboard:
- Invoice Notifications:
- View invoices received from various Clients.
- Accept or dispute payments with clear status indicators.
- Payment Details:
- Track payments in escrow, pending release, and received funds.
- Real-Time Updates:
- Receive instant notifications when an invoice status changes (using WebSocket updates).
- Common Components:
- Header & Navigation Bar:
- Display the app logo, wallet status (using Solana Wallet Adapter), and a role-specific menu (e.g., Clients might see “Create Invoice” while Freelancers might see “My Invoices”).
- Responsive Modals & Forms:
- Invoice creation forms should allow the user to select between direct crypto payments or converting fiat amounts via Mercuryo.
- Interactive Tables & Charts:
- Use visualization libraries (Chart.js, Recharts) to represent financial data dynamically.
- Real-Time & Reactive UX:
- Implement state management (using Redux or React Context API) to manage user sessions, wallet connection, and role-specific data.
- Ensure smooth transitions, responsive design, and immediate feedback for actions (toast notifications, loading skeletons).

4. Deployment & Testing on Replit
- Local Development Setup:
- Run the Solana localnet and deploy the Anchor program via Replit’s shell.
- Start the Node.js backend server and verify API endpoints.
- Use Replit’s web preview to ensure the React frontend loads properly, with correct role-based routes.
- Testing:
- On-Chain:
- Write Anchor tests (TypeScript) in the /tests folder to simulate invoice creation, payment processing, and refund scenarios.
- Backend:
- Use Jest/Mocha for testing API endpoints.
- Frontend:
- Implement component tests with React Testing Library to verify both Client and Freelancer interfaces and ensure proper role selection at wallet creation.
- Documentation:
- Create a README.md file that explains installation, configuration (including environment variables), running tests, and deploying the application from Replit.
