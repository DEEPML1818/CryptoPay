Objective:
Enhance the CryptoPay MVP on Replit by improving the payment module and invoice management. Specifically, the system must:
- Record Real Transaction Data:
- The Transaction History module should capture and display actual transaction details as they occur on the blockchain. This data should include information such as transaction IDs, timestamps, payment amounts, and statuses.
- Streamlined Invoice Management with Direct Payments:
- In the Manage Invoices section, implement a "Direct Pay" button that allows users to immediately process a payment on a selected invoice.
- This button must trigger the underlying on-chain function (via your backend API endpoint and proper PDA usage) to transfer funds directly from the user's wallet, bypassing escrow if needed for instant payments.
- Once a transaction is completed, update both the user’s dashboard and transaction history with real-time status changes.

Requirements:
- For the Transaction History Module:
- Fetch real transaction data through the connected wallet (using the Solana Wallet Adapter) and backend API endpoints.
- Ensure that every payment action (direct pay or escrow-payment release) is recorded with:
- Transaction ID: To verify and track payments.
- Timestamp: Indicating when the transaction was processed.
- Amount & Currency: Reflecting the exact value transferred.
- Status: Showing if the transaction is pending, completed, or failed.
- Display this data in an interactive table or list view that auto-updates in real time.
- For the Manage Invoices Module:
- Include a clear, prominent "Direct Pay" button for each invoice in the management interface.
- On clicking "Direct Pay":
- Validate the invoice details and user authorization.
- Immediately initiate a direct on-chain transaction for the invoice payment using the backend API.
- Update the invoice status and record the transaction details.
- Provide visual feedback (e.g., loading spinners or toast notifications) to confirm the transaction status as it executes.
- Integration & Testing:
- Ensure that the entire flow (from initiating a payment via the direct pay button to recording it in the transaction history) is live and working on the Solana devnet (or testnet, as per your environment).
- Test the interface by making real transactions to verify that the data updates are accurately reflected across all modules.
- Update the Replit environment settings so that every component (frontend, backend, and smart contracts) works in concert with actual blockchain interactions.

Example Code Snippets:
- Frontend (React) – Direct Pay Button:
// In your ManageInvoices component
const handleDirectPay = async (invoiceId, amount) => {
  try {
    // Call your backend API to process direct payment
    const response = await fetch(`/api/invoice/${invoiceId}/direct-pay`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ amount }),
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    if (result.success) {
      // Update state to reflect the new transaction in history
      alert("Payment processed successfully!");
    } else {
      alert("Payment failed. Please try again.");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Direct Payment Error:", error);
  }
};

return (
  <div className="invoice-item">
    <h3>Invoice #{invoice.id}</h3>
    <p>Amount: {invoice.amount} {invoice.currency}</p>
    {/* Direct Pay Button */}
    <button onClick={() => handleDirectPay(invoice.id, invoice.amount)}>
      Direct Pay
    </button>
  </div>
);
- Backend (Node.js/Express) – Direct Pay Endpoint:
app.post('/api/invoice/:id/direct-pay', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { amount } = req.body;

  try {
    // Validate the invoice and user authorization
    // ...

    // Initiate the on-chain direct payment via Solana Web3/Anchor
    const transactionSignature = await processDirectPayment(id, amount);

    // Log transaction data into your database
    await recordTransaction({
      invoiceId: id,
      amount,
      transactionSignature,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      status: 'Completed'
    });

    res.json({ success: true, transactionSignature });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Direct Pay Error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, error: error.message });
  }
});
- Transaction History Display:
// In your TransactionHistory component
const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchTransactions = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/transactions');
    const data = await response.json();
    setTransactions(data.transactions);
  };

  // Poll or use WebSocket for real-time updates
  fetchTransactions();
  const interval = setInterval(fetchTransactions, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);

return (
  <div>
    <h2>Transaction History</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Timestamp</th>
          <th>Amount</th>
          <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {transactions.map((txn) => (
          <tr key={txn.id}>
            <td>{txn.transactionSignature}</td>
            <td>{new Date(txn.timestamp).toLocaleString()}</td>
            <td>{txn.amount}</td>
            <td>{txn.status}</td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
);
