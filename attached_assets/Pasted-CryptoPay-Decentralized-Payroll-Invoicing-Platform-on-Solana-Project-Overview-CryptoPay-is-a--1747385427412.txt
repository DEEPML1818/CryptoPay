CryptoPay: Decentralized Payroll & Invoicing Platform on Solana

Project Overview
CryptoPay is a full-stack decentralized platform where businesses and freelancers can manage payroll, generate invoices (in fiat and cryptocurrency), and process payments seamlessly. The system leverages Solana’s high-speed blockchain using Rust and Anchor for smart contract development, integrates Mercuryo for fiat-to-crypto conversions, and uses Streamflow SDK for automated payment processing. A React frontend provides a user-friendly dashboard revealing live invoice, payroll, and payment data.

Project Structure
The repository should be organized as a monorepo with the following directories:
/ (project root)
├── /client       # React-based frontend with Tailwind CSS
├── /server       # Node.js backend using Express.js for API endpoints and integration logic
└── /program      # Solana smart contract built with Rust and Anchor framework


Use Git for version control. Replit supports multi-file projects, so set up the workspace with these directories to enable a seamless development environment.

Smart Contract (Program) Development
Location: /program
Tools: Rust, Anchor Framework
Requirements & Functions:
- Invoice Creation and Management:
- Accounts & State:
- Create an Invoice account containing:
- Invoice ID
- Business (payer) and freelancer (payee) public keys
- Amount due (in SOL or token equivalent)
- Payment status (e.g., Pending, Paid, Released, Refunded)
- Deadline and metadata (description, timestamp, etc.)
- Instruction Functions:
- create_invoice(ctx, parameters): Initializes a new invoice with provided details.
- update_invoice(ctx, invoice_id, new_parameters): Modify invoice details if necessary.
- Escrow & Payment Processing:
- Instruction Functions:
- pay_invoice(ctx, invoice_id): Transfers funds from the payer to an escrow account managed by the contract.
- release_payment(ctx, invoice_id): Releases escrowed funds to the freelancer upon job completion verification.
- refund_payment(ctx, invoice_id): Refunds the payer if conditions aren’t met.
- Use Anchor’s macros and error-handling to ensure atomic state transitions, protecting against race conditions and unauthorized access.
- Testing:
- Write unit and integration tests using Anchor’s testing framework in the /program/tests directory (TypeScript test scripts may be used).

Backend API Development
Location: /server
Tools: Node.js, Express.js, @solana/web3.js
Key Endpoints & Responsibilities:
- Invoice Endpoints:
- POST /api/invoice:
- Accepts invoice data from the frontend.
- Calls the Solana smart contract’s create_invoice instruction using the Solana Web3.js library.
- GET /api/invoices:
- Retrieves a list of invoices, optionally filtering by status or user.
- Payment & Conversion Endpoints:
- POST /api/invoice/:id/pay:
- Initiates the payment process.
- Uses the Streamflow SDK to schedule and automate payment disbursement (integration based on their GitHub docs).
- POST /api/invoice/:id/convert:
- Integrates with Mercuryo’s API to handle on-ramping/off-ramping.
- Converts fiat amounts to crypto (and vice versa) using API calls as per Mercuryo Developer Docs (Mercuryo Docs).
- Integration & Environment:
- Use environment variables (.env file) to securely store API keys and configuration parameters for Mercuryo and Streamflow.
- Implement error handling, logging, and input validation to safeguard financial transactions.

Frontend Development
Location: /client
Tools: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Web3 libraries (e.g., @solana/wallet-adapter)
Key Features:
- Invoice & Payment Dashboard:
- Build a responsive dashboard that shows:
- Active invoices and their statuses (Pending, Paid, etc.)
- Payment history and transaction details
- Integration status for fiat conversions and escrow status
- Invoice Generation:
- A form that allows users to create a new invoice:
- Fields for amount (support both crypto and fiat display), description, due date, and recipient details
- Options to choose between direct crypto payment or conversion via Mercuryo
- Wallet Integration & Notifications:
- Integrate with Solana-compatible wallets (e.g., Phantom) to connect users’ crypto wallets.
- Provide visual cues and notifications for state changes (e.g., successful payment, invoice updates).
- API Integration:
- Call endpoints from the backend (/api/invoice, /api/invoice/:id/pay, etc.) using Axios or Fetch API.
- Display real-time status updates by polling or via WebSocket (if real-time alerts are needed).

Deployment & Testing
- Local Development:
- Deploy the smart contract locally using the Solana CLI and Anchor’s localnet.
- Run the Node.js server locally and ensure API endpoints are reachable from the React frontend.
- Use Replit’s built-in terminal and preview tools for iterative development and testing.
- Testing Suites:
- Smart Contract: Use Anchor tests (TypeScript) to simulate various invoice lifecycle scenarios.
- Backend: Write tests with a framework like Mocha/Chai or Jest for API endpoints.
- Frontend: Use Jest/React Testing Library for component testing.
- Documentation:
- Include a README that explains setup steps, environment variables configuration, testing instructions, and deployment guidelines.

Additional Considerations
- Security:
- Enforce strict smart contract authorization so that only the intended business or freelancer can trigger state transitions.
- Validate all incoming requests on the backend to prevent injection attacks.
- Scalability:
- Design the Node.js API to handle concurrent requests and manage state transitions securely.
- Modularity:
- Keep the codebase modular so that additional payment integrations or features (e.g., cross-chain support via Wormhole) can be added without major restructuring.
- Logging & Monitoring:
- Integrate logging (using tools like Winston or Bunyan) on the server for debugging and audit trails.
